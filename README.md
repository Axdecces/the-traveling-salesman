visualisation of a well-known programming problem and my attempts to solve it

this implementation contains an random algorithm, an algorithm based on permutations and a genetic algorithm

the algorithm can be changed during runtime via the keyboard

pressing '1' changes the algorithm to random
pressing '2' changes the algorithm to permutation
pressing '3' changes the algorithm to genetic
the points are kept while changing algorithm

pressing 'space' resets the algorithm and generates new points
pressing 'escape' exits the program
